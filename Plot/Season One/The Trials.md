Overview:
	This a plot device to throw everything on their head. I want it be the emotional highlight at the end of season one when people see their hero's be pushed to the absolute limits and then watching in horror as the protagonists deal with these life altering consequences. Its suppose to set the tone for the rest of the show and set up how these characters will move forward with their lives. 

Reason:
	Why do these trials happen in the first place? Honestly, I'm still trying to construct how the first season will go as first impressions matter, but it'll be different compared to the rest of the show.
