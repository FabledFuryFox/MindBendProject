Overview:
	The background antagonist that is the cause to a lot of problems within the town of [[Pharos's Creek]]. But more importantly, is a very recent 'god' (As they are a false god) to come at about the same time of the tech enlightenment.  
Unknowns:
	He was the main force to drive the Great Catastrophe. A demon wanting to achieve godhood through stealing the Godseed from all life to ascend. As this plan was set into motion, he took a large amount of this Godseed, disarming and ending the Golden Age because of the lack of ability. When in ritual to take hold of this power, a failsafe was imposed, sending him into a void dimensional state and slowly releasing the Godseed back into life. Now, that he shed that skin like a snake and gained trust through revealing revelations on science progression, his presence is broadly known and worshipped. This is to help further his goals to manipulate the conscious into reversing the ritual and bring him back into the physical dimensions.
