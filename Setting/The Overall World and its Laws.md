(Overwrite) - I wanted to take this world that we have and turn it on its head. This way I could add magic in a sensible way and create an atmosphere of mystery and uncertainty. Within an area of about a county found within the United States, the reality of our world is pushed closer to that of one that exists in a more metaphysical sense. This causes a world in which both effect each other much more intimately, held together by a veil of flesh. -

Now I want the main Setting to take place in the Oma Cluster, where magic is much more prevalent and the universe that Arcane Punk takes place in. I have the entire magic system written in a journal, but at this point in time, magic has been disappearing from the world, replaced by electronics and machines. The Lore behind that is complicated but people can use simple spells and abilities and can use electronics to use magic as well. So its like cyberpunk levels of looking tech but with 90's retro style and understanding when it comes to the electronics. It'll take place in the Planetary Domain of the Fourth Light,  a rimworld far removed from the centralized human planer system. Meaning, they sit on the edge of the colonized planes of existence, and don't receive many visitors outside of their own domain. Think the American Colonies back in the day, but instead of an ocean dividing it from the rest of the known world, They're in completely different realities from each other instead, separated even more by the fact that multiple realities stand between them.

Domain of the Fourth Light
	This is the name of the plane this planet is on, its also the name of the planet once planetary systems were discovered over the ages. Founded and settled 3,000 years ago since the Golden Age of Magic only recently receiving 1st contact 200 years ago after the dark ages the world is filled with classical/fantasy like construction with modern influences in major cities and slight influence in towns and almost no influence in rural areas. Mostly inhabited by base humans other subspecies do reside like beastuals and elves. I'll have to come up with a good history on this world since its been around for quite a bit~ 
	
	History: Upon the discovery of this plane and subsequence planet, it was weird.     Usually the planets placement is similiar in the universe it resides in to the planet that was used to travel there; however, this one exisist in a completly different area. There were rumors of strange monolithic type building found at the conners of the world while strange being were reported. It was infrequent enough to be regarded as rumors and the place was settled because of its ideal living conditions such as water, food and tempertaure.
	

	
How?:
	in short, a disaster born by those of ancient flesh seeking God's domain in the wrong places. The Area of dead ambitions provokes a lasting, dying breath of silence from the forgotten. god's first people, given much, turned sour in the face of meekness. They developed a machine to bring about the connection between reality and what resides from outside of this matter filled void. To allow access to god eternal and divine power trapped far out of reach from this deserted, physical land. A interwoven betrayal of father and Beast. For the construct did not achieve this function, as the prince of dark inspiration designed but masterfully deceived god's children into the establishment of something incomplete from perfection. The fallen divine engine continues to hum, quietly, causing muted chaos in the world above. 
	The Corporeality Engine attempted to merge our reality with that of the supernatural/metaphysical reality that runs parallel with ours. It was not successful, only managing to closen the gap between the two and only in the area around the engine (about a county's length of land).

The effects: 
	 Usually these two realities are minimally effected by each other, however; due to being much closer, this has changed drastically. It's hard to describe what this metaphysical reality is like, so think of it as a place where the realms of consciousness and laws of the physical originated from. its where our spirits are from. What this allows is the manifestation of our souls to effect the world physically. Through the exertion of our spirits/consciousness we can manipulate things like: (matter, forces, life) giving rise to magic in our world that follows closely to my magic system. It also causes immense amounts of feelings, like the fear of the dark, to manifest in raw flesh (Manifested Anomaly: A creature that was created, usually, through subconscious efforts of the collective. Often times through the personification of they're environments, feelings, or situations). It also allows for other consciousnesses to effect and manifest in our world, like Spirits, Angels, Demons, and Eldrazi. 

Why Can't most see?:
	Within this area of effect resides normal people who have no idea something like this exists, most don't even notice anything out of their usual normal. Towns in the woods who seem pretty ordinary when glanced at for a second. So why? How do they live their lives without witnessing the strange right in front of them? Most can't see what they're not looking for, and most don't go looking for or even believe in the 'supernatural'.  That and most metaphysical things aren't fully manifested into matter. So it would be like looking for something that can only be seen in infrared, you can't do it naturally. But this helps protect them, there's power in conscious observation like the double slit experiment shows. To something that resides in the metaphysical plane, a person that is consciously observing it to someone who isn't is like seeing something that's usually invisible but is now fully formed and Infront of you. Because, metaphysical beings have a similar veil as well, it works both ways. Once a being has the conscious intention to do anything (within a certain level) to a person, that person will be able to bear witness to that manifestation. So most keep separated from each other. To add to this, There will be a distinct divide between those who know and those who don't. A magic system that follows as soft magic for those who don't understand what is going on, but a hard magic system for those who do.
