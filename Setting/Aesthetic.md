What I want: 
	A dark but colorful world wrapped in mystery. Where the mind finds wonder in its walls and captivates the audience withe the emotions they feel. A grand feeling to its scope, where even the town itself feels unreal but natural. 
	
What's the identity of the story?:
	What makes up the inner workings of a soul? What makes up the identity of an individual? This story is an exploration into these questions and how people, situations, and environments can change someone.
